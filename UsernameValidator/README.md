# Username Validator
The motivation to bulid this application is **Instagram**. While we signup for it, then we will be asked to create a username. The
username provided must not be taken by other users and it must satisfy certain conditions. Only then we will be provided the username. 

This application works similar to that. Username provided by the user must satisfy below conditions in order to get validated.
+ It should not start with a period.
+ It should not end with a period.
+ It should not start with an underscore.
+ It should not end with an underscore.
+ It can only contain small letters, numbers, period or an underscore.
